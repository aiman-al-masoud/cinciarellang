# Bools

Booleans are the values `true` and `false`. They behave like in most other programming languages. They can be combined in boolean expressions with the classical set of operators:

```
true && false; // false
```

```
true || false; // true
```

```
!true; // false
```

There is no ~~`null`~~ keyword in Cinciarellang. You cannot explicitly force a variable to point to a null pointer, the only way to achieve that is if you declare it and don't ever initialize it.
