# Bools

Booleans are the values `true` and `false`. They behave like in most other programming languages. They can be combined in boolean expressions with the classical set of operators:

```
true && false; // false
```

```
true || false; // true
```

```
!true; // false
```

There is no ~~`null`~~ in Cinciarellang.
