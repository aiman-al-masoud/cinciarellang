# Lists

A list is an ordered set of potentially heterogenous elements. You can create a list through this common literal notation:

```
x = [0, 1.0, true, []]
```

You can use the `to` operator to quickly create a list from the specified range of integers:

```
x = 0 to 10
```

This will create a list that goes from 0 to 10 included.
