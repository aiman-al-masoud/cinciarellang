# Declarations

Declarations are another kind of statement. A declaration is like a promise that a certain variable of a given type will exist, eventually. In some cases, this promise can be enforced by the interpreter, like when not initializing a class's declared field, or when assigning the wrong type to some variable. But this is mostly a feature intended to make the life of a (future) compiler easier.

## Variables

```
x:int;
```
... this declares a variable called "x" of type int.

```
x = 'hello world!'; 
```
... this erroneous assignment will throw an exception.


```
x = 1;
```
... this assignment is accepted.
