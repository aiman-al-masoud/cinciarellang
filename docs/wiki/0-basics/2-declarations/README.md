# Declarations

Declarations are another kind of statement. A declaration is like a promise that a certain variable of a given type will exist, eventually. In some cases, this promise can be enforced by the interpreter, like when creating an object from a class with declared fields. But this is mostly a feature intended to make the life of a (future) compiler easier.
