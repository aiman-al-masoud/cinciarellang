# Cinciarellang!

Cinciarellang is a brand-new high-level, statically typed, multi-paradigm, general purpose programming language running on the JVM.

Its main features include:

* First class support for deep and immutable copies of objects.📋🧊
* Pure functions, with optionally impure features. λ
* Static typing and type inference. ❓
* Sugary and addictive high-level syntax! 🍭🍬
* Support for Java classes and objects. ☕

Coding in it should feel like coding in a statically typed dialect of Python with functional overtones and native support for the wealth of libraries written in Java.
