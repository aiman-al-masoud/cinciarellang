# Cinciarellang!

Cinciarellang is a brand-new, high-level, statically typed, multi-paradigm scripting language, running on top of the JVM.

Its main features include:

* First class support for deep and immutable copies of objects📋🧊
* Pure and impure functions. λ x->x
* Terse and sugary high-level syntax 🍭🍬
* Static typing and basic type inference ❓
* Support for Java classes and objects. ☕
* A little help with concurrency, through the Promise API 🎁

Coding in it should feel like coding in a statically typed dialect of Python with functional overtones and native support for the wealth of libraries written in Java.
