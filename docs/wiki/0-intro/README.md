# Cinciarellang!

Cinciarellang is a high-level, statically typed, multi-paradigm general purpose programming language.

Its main features include:

* First class support for deep and immutable copies.
* Pure functions, with optionally impure features.
* Static typing and type inference.
* Sugary and addictive high-level syntax.
* Support for Java classes and objects.

Coding in it should feel like coding in a statically typed dialect of Python with functional overtones and full support for the wealth of libraries written in Java.
