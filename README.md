Cinciarellang🐦 is a brand-new multi-paradigm✨ scripting language🐱‍💻, running on top of the JVM ☕.

Its main features include:

* Out-of-the-box support for deep and immutable copies of objects📋🧊
* Pure and impure functions λ x -> x
* Terse and sugary high-level syntax 🍭🍬
* Support for Java classes and objects ☕

⚠️ Please note that this project is just a proof of concept, currently (and probably never) ready for production!⚠️ 

## Building 🚧
To build it on your favorite *nix system, run the `./build.sh` script. You'll want to have the Java 11 SDK installed.
